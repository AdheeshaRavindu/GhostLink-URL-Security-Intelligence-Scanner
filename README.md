## How It Works

GhostLink analyzes URLs across six security dimensions and assigns a composite risk score (0-100):
- **Phishing Risk**: Detects common phishing techniques
- **HTTPS & SSL**: Validates secure transport
- **Security Headers**: Audits HTTP security configurations
- **Domain Intelligence**: Analyzes domain structure and patterns
- **Reputation**: Evaluates URL composition and characteristics
- **Redirect Chain**: Detects suspicious redirects

Each category is weighted based on security impact, providing a comprehensive threat assessment.

## Technology Stack
